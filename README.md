# Excel-Phish

## Updated by spyr0-sec
- Changed Base64 encoded function 
- Improved UX features to make phishing more successful
- Recreated bad password error message as a more convincing userform
- Refactored code and added comments

## TODO by the attacker
- Change variables within AutoOpen Module
- Add data to document to make it same size as victim document to increase phishing success
- Change 'Excel-Phish' filename to match your victim document

The xlsm will work as-is, however you may wish to recreate the document rather than running random macros from the Internet. Therefore the three standalone VBA files have been exported for review.
